## 👉 **Opening: Setting Expectation**
*"Friends, I was expecting all of you to have pushed your repositories before today’s session. On day one, day two, day three — we built small tasks together, and those should now be visible in GitHub. Let’s check quickly: Aravind, Kshitija, Kartik, Preeti, Nitish, George, Jagdish, Akshata… I see some updates, but many of you haven’t yet implemented serialization-deserialization. That’s concerning."*

👉 **Reality Check**
*"See, I’m not just here as a faculty who lectures and leaves. I am your mentor. I can demonstrate 100 examples, but unless you apply, the learning won’t stick. And I’ll be very honest — corporate training is measured not by what I speak, but by what *you* implement. If tasks remain incomplete, then effectiveness goes down, and fingers first point at the trainer — not at the participants. I have lived this for 25+ years."*

👉 **Passion + Responsibility**
*"I don’t mind financial loss, I don’t mind discontinuing a session. But I do mind wasting time. Because teaching is my passion. I want to see each of you grow into a project-ready engineer. That only happens with hands-on practice. Theory is like watching a cricket match — exciting but you don’t become a cricketer by watching. You become one by playing."*

👉 **Expectation for Today**
\_"So here is the deal: For the next 2 hours, no new topics. Everyone must implement a **Product Catalog REST API** with proper serialization and deserialization.

* Create entities, repositories, services, and controllers.
* Apply layered architecture.
* Use dependency injection.
* Perform CRUD operations (insert, update, delete, get all, get by id).
* Save and retrieve from a JSON file.
* Test everything with Postman.

That’s all. If you face issues — fantastic! Share your screen, and we will debug together. That’s where real learning happens."\_

👉 **Mentor Authority + Care**
*"Please don’t treat me only as a faculty. A mentor sometimes has to keep a soft voice, sometimes a firm one. Just like parents scold when they care. I’m being firm today because I want to see you succeed. My only goal: you should proudly say at the end of this training — *yes, we built something real*."*

👉 **Closing Motivation**
*"Friends, 75% of the work is already done by you. Only 25% is missing. Within 2 hours, you can proudly update your GitHub with a working solution. And when your seniors ask me what you learned, I should be able to show them real evidence. That will make both you and me proud."*

👉 **Set the Mode**
Don’t worry about syllabus. In college, we completed the syllabus but didn’t build skills. In companies, syllabus is irrelevant — what matters is whether you are project-ready, whether you can deliver on time. That’s why I keep pushing you for these ***hands-on*** tasks."*

👉 **Firmness + Style**
*"You can see, I’m a very strong type trainer. Highly typecasted, highly demanding — because industry itself is demanding. If you don’t practice today, tomorrow you will be forced to practice under deadlines. Better to fail here in front of me, than in front of your project manager."*

👉 **Correctness Check**
*"If anyone feels stuck — whether your folder structure is wrong, references are not added properly, or controllers are misplaced — show me. Share your screen. Because if you don’t check today, you may have to recreate and redraw everything again tomorrow."*

👉 **Deadline Assurance**
*"And friends, tomorrow morning I want everyone with a **working solution pushed to GitHub**. Otherwise, I will not conduct the session. This is not punishment — this is discipline. If you don’t complete, the next layer cannot be built."*

👉 **1-on-1 Check-ins (Mentor Style)**

* **To Nitin:** *“Till what point have you reached in implementing the exercise from Friday?”*
* **To Ashish:** *“Your program.cs file should not be cluttered with endpoints. Minimal APIs are fine for demos, but in a real Web API project, use Controllers. Keep services and repositories in separate class libraries. See my Day 9 folder — follow that structure.”*
* **To Balaji:** *“If Git push is giving you issues, no problem. Just zip the solution and share on WhatsApp. The important thing is — I should be able to see your work.”*
* **To Karthikeyan:** *“Good you’re revising Day 9 content. But after trying out small array functions, don’t forget to complete the Web API task. Explore Array.Reverse, test it, and confirm. Remember, try-outs are for practice, but project tasks are for completion.”*
* **To Arif:** *“Excellent — you created a clean solution with entities, repository, service, and web app projects. References are added properly, and you’re implementing methods. This is exactly the layering I wanted. Just don’t stop halfway — push it on GitHub, and update me.”*

👉 **Accountability Through GitHub**
*"Now one important request — I want **all your GitHub repository URLs in one place**. Some links are missing in chat, some are broken. Without those, even subject matter experts cannot review your work. So please maintain a single text file with all links. If yours is missing, ping me directly on WhatsApp. My only condition: by tomorrow, everyone’s repository should be visible here."*

👉 **Closing Motivation**
*"Friends, remember — hands-on is not about typing code blindly. It’s about **owning your solution**. Today, your GitHub is your resume. Tomorrow, when someone asks what you learned, you can show real evidence. That is the difference between college syllabus and corporate readiness."*
