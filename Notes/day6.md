## üå± 1. Minimal API Strategy

Think of **Minimal APIs** like a **startup garage**:

* You want to build something *fast* with the least boilerplate.
* You don‚Äôt want too many files, attributes, or ceremony.
* You just write everything in `Program.cs` (or split later if needed).

üëâ **Code Style** (short, simple):

```csharp
var app = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args).Build();

app.MapGet("/hello", () => "Hello World");
app.MapPost("/products", (Product p) => Results.Ok(p));

app.Run();
```

‚úÖ **Best for**:

* Microservices (small, focused APIs).
* Prototyping, hackathons, POCs.
* Lightweight APIs with fewer endpoints.
* When you don‚Äôt need heavy frameworks like filters, attributes, or model binding.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**:

* Can get messy when APIs grow big (hundreds of routes).
* Harder to organize complex validation, filters, authorization, etc.
* Developers may reinvent patterns that controllers already provide.

 

## üè¢ 2. Controller-based Web API

Think of **Controllers** like a **corporate office setup**:

* You want structure, clear separation of concerns.
* You use attributes (`[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`) to define routes.
* You can add filters, model validation, versioning, dependency injection neatly.

üëâ **Code Style**:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Product> Get() => products;

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Post(Product p)
    {
        products.Add(p);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(Get), new { id = p.Id }, p);
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Best for**:

* Enterprise apps.
* Large teams (clean structure = easier collaboration).
* Apps needing filters, middleware, model validation, authentication/authorization.
* When maintainability & conventions matter.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Downside**:

* Slightly more boilerplate.
* Not as quick for small POCs.

 

## üéØ 3. When to Use What

* **Use Minimal API**:

  * For small microservices.
  * For quick POCs.
  * For performance-critical endpoints with minimal overhead.
  * When you want to experiment and move fast.

* **Use Controllers**:

  * For enterprise-scale applications.
  * When working with big teams.
  * If you need features like versioning, filters, validation, or Swagger conventions.
  * When you want **clean separation of routes, logic, and structure**.

 

## üß† Mentor Tip

* Minimal API is like **short notes** ‚Üí quick & light.
* Controllers are like a **full textbook** ‚Üí detailed & structured.

Both are **first-class citizens** in ASP.NET Core. In fact, you can **mix them**:

* Start with Minimal API for small services.
* Use Controllers where structure is required.

 
If you want to **explicitly generate an ASP.NET Core Web API project with controllers**, the correct **.NET CLI command** is:

```bash
dotnet new webapi --use-controllers -o TrailWebAPI
```


### üîé What this does:

* `webapi` ‚Üí chooses the Web API project template.
* `--use-controllers` ‚Üí ensures the project is set up **controller-based** (not just minimal API).
* `-o TrailWebAPI` ‚Üí creates the project in a folder named **TrailWebAPI**.


### ‚úÖ After creating

```bash
cd TrailWebAPI
dotnet run
```

* The project will have a `Controllers` folder with **WeatherForecastController.cs** inside.
* Swagger/OpenAPI UI will be enabled ‚Üí open `https://localhost:5001/swagger`.

 

‚ö° Mentor Tip:

* `dotnet new webapi` (without `--use-controllers`) ‚Üí from .NET 6+, defaults to **minimal APIs**.
* `dotnet new webapi --use-controllers` ‚Üí gives you the **classic controller-based structure** (like older MVC-style APIs).
